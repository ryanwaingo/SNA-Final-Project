This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook (by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*), the results appear beneath the code. Here is a sample chunk of code.

```{r}
print ("hello world")
```

You can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
